1. Installed Node.js, and set up Supabase and Vercel to deploy app with
- Located and saved system variables (link, anon_key, and direct connection string)
- Debugged issue where package.json file tried to automatically update the supabase-js version, leading to VERY odd nonsensical bugs

2. Set up "species" table in Supabase table editor

3. Rather than my original plan of declaring a button in species-card.tsx and having it call a function when clicked (the way I would've with Python), 
I instead directly called a function which would return that button, with all of its functionality already built into it.
