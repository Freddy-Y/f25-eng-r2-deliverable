1. Installed Node.js, and set up Supabase and Vercel to deploy app with
- Located and saved system variables (link, anon_key, and direct connection string)
- Debugged issue where package.json file tried to automatically update the supabase-js version, leading to VERY odd nonsensical bugs

2. Set up "species" table in Supabase table editor
